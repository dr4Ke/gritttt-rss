		<p>In late 2011 Google »integrated« several of its Reader's features into GooglePlus. Those features became useless after what we feel was an amputation of vital parts. We mainly missed the sharing goodness and as it happened, we were looking for Google alternatives anyway at that time.

        </div>

		To replace the core functionality, we settled with the open-source feed reader <a href="http://tt-rss.org/">tiny, tiny rss</a> (which is neither <i>tiny</i> nor <i>tiny, tiny</i> by the way but rather great), in short: <i>tt-rss</i>. Even though it exceeds Google Reader in some aspects (<a href="http://www.nicolashoening.de?blog&nr=115">yay, self-hosting and open source!</a>), for us it lacks a few neat features, too. The things we miss and are about to (re-)build are:</p>
		<div id="features">
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">1</p>
				<p class="heading heading-driveby">Drive-by-Sharing</p>
				<p class="description">
					Share any page you see on the fly through a bookmarklet, even though you're not subscribed to the website's feed (it might not even have one). See the screenshot above for an example.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">2</p>
				<p class="heading heading-shared">Shared-Widget</p>
				<p class="description">
					To show the non-tt-rss-using world what you share with other <i>tt-rss</i>-users, <i>gritttt-rss</i> provides a widget that adds the latest items from <i>tt-rss</i>' public shared feed to your website (an example can be seen embedded on the lower right on <a href="http://www.nicolashoening.de">Nic's website</a>).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">3</p>
				<p class="heading heading-import">Import</p>
				<p class="description">
					In order to make the move feel like Google Reader never happened, <i>gritttt-rss</i> lets you import your historic starred and/or shared items from Google Reader into <i>tt-rss</i>.

              We hope an image helps to see how we envision these three ways for articles (that you want to share with the world) to flow around your <i>tt-rss</i> instance (click to enlarge). All that is needed as direct addition to <i>tt-rss</i> is one <span class="alert">dedicated feed</span> in its database:
