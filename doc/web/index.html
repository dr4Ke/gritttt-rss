    <p>In late 2011 Google »integrated« several of its Reader's features into GooglePlus. Those features became useless after what we feel was an amputation of vital parts. We mainly missed the sharing goodness and as it happened, we were looking for Google alternatives anyway at that time.

            <img src="img/screen-driveby-small.png"/>
          </a>
        </div>

		<p>
		To replace the core functionality, we settled with the open-source feed reader <a href="http://tt-rss.org/">tiny, tiny rss</a> (which is neither <i>tiny</i> nor <i>tiny, tiny</i> by the way, but rather great), in short: <i>tt-rss</i>. Even though it exceeds Google Reader in some aspects (<a href="http://www.nicolashoening.de?blog&nr=115">yay, self-hosting and open source!</a>), for us it lacks a few neat features, too. The things we miss and are about to (re-)build are:</p>
		<div id="features">
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">1</p>
				<p class="heading heading-driveby">Drive-by-Sharing</p>
				<p class="description">
					Share any page you see on the fly through a bookmarklet, even though you're not subscribed to the website's feed (it might not even have one). See the screenshot above for an example.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">2</p>
				<p class="heading heading-shared">Shared-Widget</p>
				<p class="description">
					To show the non-tt-rss-using world what you share with other <i>tt-rss</i>-users, <i>gritttt-rss</i> provides a widget that adds the latest items from <i>tt-rss</i>' public shared feed to your website (an example can be seen embedded on the lower right on <a href="http://www.nicolashoening.de">Nic's website</a>).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item"> 
				<p class="no">3</p>
				<p class="heading heading-import">Import</p>
				<p class="description">
					In order to make the move feel like Google Reader never happened, <i>gritttt-rss</i> lets you import your historic starred and/or shared items from Google Reader into <i>tt-rss</i>.

              We hope an image helps to see how we envision these three ways for articles (that you want to share with the world) to flow around your <i>tt-rss</i> instance (click to enlarge). All that is needed as direct addition to <i>tt-rss</i> is one <span class="alert">dedicated feed</span> in its database:

    <h3>Where to go next with this?</h3>
    <p>Fundamentally, <i>gritttt-rss</i> allows a user to keep a list of their bookmarked links. (S)he can also share them via RSS and a widget, but 
    collecting bookmarklets is the primary functionality:</p>
    <em>The more I think about it, the more I believe that the links I bookmark everyday are an important dimension of my online life. I bookmark a couple links everyday,
    and years later I can look back and understand what I was interested in during certain times.</em>
    <p>Unlike online services like <a href="http://del.icio.us">Delicious</a> or <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, however, the user hosts the list
    of bookmarked links him- or herself - (s)he really owns the data. And the method (the <i> gritttt-rss</i> code) is open-source.</p>
    <p>To make <i>gritttt-rss</i> work, we have used <i>tt-rss</i> as the vehicle of choice. It hosts the list of bookmarked links in its database and via its
    RSS-subscriptions, it provides a very convenient method to bookmark links (via sharing or starring). Basically, we only added the feature to share any other website 
    you're browsing on. However, <a href="https://github.com/nhoening/gritttt-rss/issues?milestone=2"><i>gritttt-rss</i> could also be independent of <i>tt-rss</i></a> - 
    it could do its work of building up a self-hosted list of bookmarks using other software (e.g. a different RSS Reader) as vehicle, 
    or even write only to an archive of plain RSS files.</p>
    <p>This is just something that is on our minds now. As it stands, <i>gritttt-rss</i> is working very pleasantly for us and we already keep track of what has been
    important to us every day :)</p>
