This allows you to import your shared items from your Google Reader account to 
your tt-rss database.

Preparation
------------
1)
First, make sure you have a backup of your current tt-rss database.
It probably is also a good idea to stop feed updates while you
are doing this. I am not responsible for data loss or corruption.

2)
You need to export your shared/starred items from your Google account.
Go to Google Reader -> settings, and export the shared/starred items in Google's 
custom json format. Store the export in this directory. The files should be 
called 'shared-items.json' or 'starred-items.json'.

3)
Make sure a dedicted feed exists in your tt-rss. You can insert it via executing 
the SQL in the file 'create-tt-unifeed.sql', which you can find in the 
main directory. Take note of the ID this feed has in the table ttrss_feeds
(You'll need that to create imports).

Importing
-----------
1)
Execute the 'import.py' script (tell it your user Id & the feed ID when
it asks for them). 
You should now have a file called 'tt-import.sql' in this directory.

2)
Import the resulting SQL in 'tt-import-sql' into your tt-rss database
(via some import functionality, e.g. with myphpadmin)
