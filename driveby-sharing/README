A Drive-by sharing widget (share any web page in your tt-rss)
=================================================================

1. Put files in a dir on your webserver.
   You can put all files in any directory on your webserver. The only exception is share.php,
   which needs to be in your tt-rss root directory.

2. Make sure a dedicated feed exists in your tt-rss. You can insert it via executing 
   the SQL in the file 'create-tt-unifeed.sql', which you can find in the 
   main directory. After creating the dedicated feed, look up the table 'ttrss_feeds' and take note of the feed's ID.

3. Adjust feed ID and user ID in share.php 

4. Adjust paths in dialog.js:
   * host: URL of the host on which tt-rss resides, e.g. www.example.com
   * path_to_grittt: path on that host to the directory containing form.html and dialog.css 

5. Adjust path to your site in bookmarklet.js
   Replace 'http://www.example.com/gritttt-rss' with the URL to the directory containing dialog.js

6. Copy content of bookmarklet.js into a bookmark of your browser.
