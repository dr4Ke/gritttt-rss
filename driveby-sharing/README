A Drive-by sharing widget (share any web page in your tt-rss)
=================================================================

1. Put files in a dir on your webserver.
<<<<<<< HEAD
   You can put all files in any directory on your webserver. The only exception is share.php,
   which needs to be in your tt-rss root directory.

2. Make sure a dedicated feed exists in your tt-rss. You can insert it via executing 
   the SQL in the file 'create-tt-unifeed.sql', which you can find in the 
   main directory. After creating the dedicated feed, look up the table 'ttrss_feeds' and take note of the feed's ID.

3. Adjust feed ID and user ID in share.php 
   The feed ID is the ID of the feed you created in 2. The user is the tt-rss user, and his ID is most likely 1, if you log in with the user 'admin'. That is the standard case, if you use a multi-user tt-rss, fill in the ID you use in that context. 

4. Adjust paths in dialog.js:
   * host: URL of the host on which tt-rss resides, e.g. www.example.com
   * path_to_grittt: path on that host to the directory containing form.html and dialog.css 

5. Adjust path to your site in bookmarklet.js
   Replace 'http://www.example.com/gritttt-rss' with the URL to the directory containing dialog.js

6. Copy content of bookmarklet.js into a bookmark of your browser.
