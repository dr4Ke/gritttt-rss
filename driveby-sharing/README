A Drive-by shareing widget (share any web page in your tt-rss)
=================================================================

1. Put files in a dir on your webserver.
   You can put all files in some directory on your webserver. The exception of share.php, that file needs to be in your tt-rss directory.

2. Make sure a dedicted feed exists in your tt-rss. You can insert it via executing 
   the SQL in the file 'create-tt-unifeed.sql', which you can find in the 
   main directory. Take note of the ID this feed has in the table ttrss_feeds.

3. Adjust feed ID and user ID in share.php 
   The feed ID is the ID of the feed you created in 2. The user is the tt-rss user, and his ID is most likely 1, if you log in with the user 'admin'. That is the standard case, if you use a multi-user tt-rss, fill in the ID you use in that context. 

4. Adjust paths in dialog.js:
   * host - URL of the host on which tt-rss is, e.g. www.example.com
   * path_to_grittt: path on that host to the directory containing form.html and dialog.css 

5. Adjust path to your site in bookmarklet.js
   Replace 'http://www.example.com/gritttt-rss' with the URL to the directory containing dialog.js

6. Copy content of bookmarklet.js in a bookmark of your browser.
