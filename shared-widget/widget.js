/*
This javascript should make HTML by letting the public tt-rss feed be transformed by our xslt. 
Then, the resulting HTML is inserted into an HTML element on the website.
A nice tutorial how this works is at http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_client.asp

This script needs to be called onload, this can be done in the body tag like in the w3schools example
or via jquery
